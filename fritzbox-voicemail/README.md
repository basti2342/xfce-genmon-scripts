Fritz!Box voicemail
===================

My router hides behind my monitors, so I can't see whether new voice messages arrived. This generic monitor script connects to my Fritz!Box via Telnet, checks for messages and displays the number including a link to the web interface.

Note: I couldn't find a way to determine whether a message is new or old, so all messages are new messages.
