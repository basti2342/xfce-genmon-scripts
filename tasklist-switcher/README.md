tasklist switcher
=================

I use multiple monitors and sometimes I run fullscreen applications on one. In this special case I want to see all "Window Buttons" on my main screen, so I see window events etc.

The tasklist switcher toggles the XFCE panel "Window Buttons" checkbox "Show windows from all workspaces or viewports". I placed a small launcher next to the "Window Buttons" widget running this script.
